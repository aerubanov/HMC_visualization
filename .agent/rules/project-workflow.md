Here is a prefered way to develope new features in this project. Ask user review after each step.

1. Start from selecting interfaces - class, method, or function and it input and outputs. Not write real implementation for now.
2. Select test cases to cover main scenarious and edge cases.
3. Implement test cases.
4. Now create actual feature implementation.
   I want to make commit after each step, so ask me for review and sujest some meaningfull commit message.
